# Study notes: Deep Learning with Python

Working through [Second Edition Fran√ßois Chollet](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition)

## Anaconda environment creation

I use this for trying things out on my CPU-only windows machine.

```
conda create -n tf python==3.9 -y
conda activate tf
pip install tensorflow
pip install nbdev jupyterlab pandas matplotlib
pip install --upgrade jupyter notebook
```
